                        <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                        <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear</p>
     <p>Is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family 
        Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the 
        island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South 
 Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy 
ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb).
  Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically 
  smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations are possibly separate 
  subspecies, but not all researchers accept this.</p>
   <p> koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development. They crawl into their mothers' 
    pouches, where they live for their first six to seven months. They are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have
     few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
