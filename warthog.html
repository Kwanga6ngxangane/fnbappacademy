                        <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                        <p>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog). </p>
     <p> They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
     <p> The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus.
</p>
   <p> . The males also have very prominent tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimetres); females' tusks are always smaller.They are largely herbivorous, but, like most suids, opportunistically eat invertebrates or small animals, even scavenging on carrion. While both species remain fairly common and widespread, and considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of desert warthog, commonly known as the Cape warthog (P. a. aethiopicus) was extinct by around 1865</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the worthogs at pen E47, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
