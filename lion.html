                        <h3>LION</h3>
                        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera,</p>
     <p>native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; 
        round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions 
        are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides</p>
   <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands.</p>
   <p> It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night
     and at twilight. </p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions at pen E45, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
