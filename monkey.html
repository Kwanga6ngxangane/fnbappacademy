                        <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                        <p> Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes,
                             also known as simians. </p>
     <p> Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. 
        Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea)
         are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms.Two separate groups of primates are referred to as "monkeys":
          New World monkeys (platyrrhines) from South and Central America and Old World monkeys (catarrhines in the superfamily 
          Cercopithecoidea) from Africa and Asia. Apes (hominoids)—consisting of gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees 
          and bonobos, and humans—are also catarrhines but were classically distinguished from monkeys. Tailless monkeys may
           be called "apes", incorrectly according to modern usage; thus the tailless Barbary macaque is historically called
            the "Barbary ape".</p>
   <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm (4+5⁄8 in) with a 172 mm (6+3⁄4 in) 
    tail and just over 100 g (3+1⁄2 oz) in weight,[45] to the male mandrill, almost 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and weighing
     up to 36 kg (79 lb).[46] Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ
      among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs
       and small animals (including insects and spiders)</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
